# ParserPro-Beta
This is the front-end template of the Parser Project I've been working on. Its purpose is to parse numerous types of Data Files required by the user. It contains the entire layout including all the web pages. This is currently in development; and the back-end still remains to be done. Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Java
